There's a space between the internal and the external. A barrier that exists between the private world of our head, and that of communication with the outside world.

The mountains of life hold us quietly in their circle of assumed safety. Sometimes, they are so bitterly high and rugged, we struggle to lift our head clear of the cold valley's to see what exists beyond them.

Having slipped and tripped, been bruised and bleeding, we finally clutch and clamber our way to the summit. Here we gain a new respect and confidence in ourselves that we can come here again and know the way.

Welcome to my mountains. May you climb them with me and find yourself a safe path to see your own horizon.
