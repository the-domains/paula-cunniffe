description: "So this is the beginning of 'this' journey. I've come so far, learned so much, and yet there's much to come in the scheme of things. All worries and concerns I previously had, pale in comparison to the new ones that crop up each day. Just when you think that nothing can get worse, there comes a new appreciation in comparison. Call it de-sensitisation if you will. From the womb to the grave, we live and learn. Here I am as a red-headed babe at my grandparents house... I remember this photo being taken. 'Kuri' the Pekinese dog is on my left, my brother Michael on his bike to my right. My father sits talking to his father on the step of the sleepout where my eldest sister was conceived eight years ago. My sister's shadow is on the bottom right of the grass."

So this is the beginning of 'this' journey. I've come so far, learned so much, and yet there's much to come in the scheme of things. All worries and concerns I previously had, pale in comparison to the new ones that crop up each day. Just when you think that nothing can get worse, there comes a new appreciation in comparison. Call it de-sensitisation if you will. From the womb to the grave, we live and learn.   
Here I am as a red-headed babe at my grandparents house... I remember this photo being taken. I would have been at least 12 months old. Nothing extraordinary happened that day to cement this event in my mind. No trauma. 'Kuri' the Pekinese dog is on my left, my brother Michael on his bike to my right. My father sits talking to his father on the step of the sleepout where my eldest sister was conceived eight years ago. My sister's shadow is on the bottom right of the grass, while my mother takes the photo. I remember thinking in my head to the effect of... what is this all about?
